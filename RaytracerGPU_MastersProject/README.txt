### A project for my masters

This project is going to have several branches that will act as 'mini-projects' to culminate in the complete project.
This plan of action is visible in Plan.txt.

All of these will require Vulkan to be installed. If you're installation is different from mine, edit the install location
in Visual Studio and modify compile.bat.

This will also be made with C++20.
